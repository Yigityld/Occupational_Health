Project Overview:
This project is designed to ensure that workers comply with safety regulations by detecting the usage of essential protective equipment, such as helmets and vests. Especially in high-risk work environments, the system provides real-time detection of whether workers are wearing their required safety gear, significantly reducing the risk of workplace accidents.

Key Features:

Advanced Visual Recognition Algorithm: Utilizes cutting-edge image processing and deep learning techniques to detect if workers are wearing helmets and vests.
Real-Time Detection: Continuously monitors workers and provides immediate alerts if required equipment is not being worn.
Seamless Integration: Easily integrates with existing security cameras, eliminating the need for additional hardware.
Data Logging and Reporting: Generates detailed reports on safety compliance, making it easier to track and improve workplace safety practices.

Benefits:
Accident Prevention: Identifies workers who are not wearing essential safety gear, helping to minimize workplace accidents.

Regulatory Compliance: Ensures that your workplace adheres to safety standards and meets legal requirements.

Easy Implementation: Simple to set up and use, with automatic updates and scalability to suit different work environments.

This system is an intelligent, practical solution for elevating workplace safety to the next level, providing both peace of mind and compliance with safety regulations.
